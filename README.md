# MidiSketch
Write midi with the browser.


JavaScript library to write midi with commands. Originally created to give support to Garrapatea.js and Bemoles.js
At this moment is on a simply version. I added new midiMessages as Garrapatea and Bemoles gets complexity.

If you'r interested in how it works look at "example_1.html".
